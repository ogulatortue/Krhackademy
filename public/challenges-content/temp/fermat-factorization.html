OPERATION: CLOSE CALL — FERMAT FACTORIZATION CONTEXT (FIELD DOSSIER)

A field lab in the border region misconfigured their hardware RNG while booting an old secure terminal. Two primes were born too close together — a sloppy manufacturing shortcut, or perhaps a low-level intelligence operative trying to leave an exploit for "trusted" allies. The resulting key pair was archived and later leaked to our training repository.

Mission briefing (what you are asked to do)
- You have one public key (pub_pub.txt) and one ciphertext (cipher.txt).
- Objective: decrypt the ciphertext to recover the flag.
