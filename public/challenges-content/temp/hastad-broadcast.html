THREE-VOICE — HÅSTAD BROADCAST CONTEXT

A compromised courier out of Embassy Section 7 accidentally duplicated a diplomatic communique across three satellite uplinks. The adversary intercepted three ciphertexts — different channels, same message — and exfiltrated them in a single archive. The courier swore it was "just paperwork", but we know better.
if an analyst can reconstruct the original message, they'll read the intended flag/secret.

Mission briefing (what you are asked to do)
- You have three public keys (key1_pub.txt, key2_pub.txt, key3_pub.txt) and three ciphertexts (cipher1.txt, cipher2.txt, cipher3.txt).
- Objective: recover the plaintext (the flag) that was broadcast identically to all three recipients.
