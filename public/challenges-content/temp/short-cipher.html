OPERATION: SHORT CIPHER — WIENER ATTACK CONTEXT (INTEL BRIEF)

An intelligence cutout deployed a fast-signing device meant to speed up message throughput in a covert channel. To save CPU cycles the developer chose a very small private exponent d. The device served its purpose — until analysts discovered that small d leaks via continued fractions.

Mission briefing (what you are asked to do)
- You have one public key (pub_pub.txt) and one ciphertext (cipher.txt).
- Objective: Recover d, then decrypt to obtain the flag.
